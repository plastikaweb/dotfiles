# vim:ft=sh
# File: $DOTFILES_PATH/bash/aliases.d/README.bal

# This is the folder where you should place your aliases files.
# Just touch your new aliases file, name it after the command you are aliasing,
# and give it a 'bal' extension to ease identifying its contents.
#
# Here you are an example of aliases file content:
#
# # vim:ft=sh
# # File: $DOTFILES_PATH/bash/aliases.d/juju.bal
#
#
# ## juju aliases
#
# alias jjb='juju bootstrap'
